visualization.py
****************

This module handles all the visualization for any evolution. The
current implementation uses "pygame"


makeScreen(W, H)
================

Make an empty screen of width "W" and height "H"


normalize(point, (olow, ohigh), (low, high))
============================================

This is a helper function. It takes a value for "point", originally
measured in the scale [olow, ohigh]. The returned value is the
corresponding value of "point" on the scale [low, high]


draw(tour, window, W, H, SCORES, COORDS)
========================================

Draws a tour of a traveling salesman, and writes the score of the tour
on the window.

Each city in the tour is represented as a red dot, with white lines
connecting them.

"COORDS" is a dictionary that contains the coordinates of the various
cities.

The fitness score of "tour" is also written to "window"


killscreen()
============

This function cleans up pygame and destroys the window and the screen;
to be called at the end of evolution.
