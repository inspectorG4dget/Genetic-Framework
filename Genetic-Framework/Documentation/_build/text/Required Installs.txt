Required Installations
**********************


Python 2.7
==========

This package requires python 2.7 and will not work with python 2.6. It
can easily be transformed into python 2.6 compliant code. Most of the
incompatibilities come from list/dict comprehension expressions


PyGame (and all its dependencies)
=================================

Used in visualization of the included TSP solver


pycontract
==========

Used for contract checking (only when testmode is True; see the
documentation for settings.py)
